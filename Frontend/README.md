# Product Management Frontend

This is the frontend component for the Product Management system, built with **React**. The frontend fetches product data from the backend API and displays it in a grid layout. It includes features such as **lazy loading** of products and a **search bar** optimized with **debounce** to improve performance.

## Features

- **Product Display**: Products are displayed in a responsive grid layout.
- **Lazy Loading**: Products are fetched dynamically as the user scrolls down the page.
- **Search Bar**: Users can search for products with a debounced input field, reducing the number of API calls.
